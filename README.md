# UpSkill

UpSkill is a platform that offers live online lessons that are local with the added opportunity to network, aimed at those who have been made redundant as a result of quarantine and isolation. Our aim is to upskill, reskill and retool learners to help them re-enter the job market.

This project was built over the weekend of 17 July - 19 July.
